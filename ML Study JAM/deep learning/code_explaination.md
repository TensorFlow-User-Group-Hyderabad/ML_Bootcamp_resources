Steps:
- Import required libraries.
- Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
- Build a neural network model.
- Train the model.
- Evaluate the model's performance.

Explanation:  

Dataset: The MNIST dataset is loaded using the mnist.load_data() function. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

Preprocessing: The images are normalized by dividing by 255 (so the pixel values fall between 0 and 1), and the labels are converted into one-hot encoded vectors for classification.

Model Architecture:
The input layer accepts 784-dimensional input (since the 28x28 images are flattened).

There is one hidden layer with 128 neurons and the ReLU activation function.

The output layer has 10 neurons, representing the 10 digit classes (0-9), and uses the softmax activation function for multi-class classification.

Training: The model is trained for 5 epochs using the Adam optimizer.

Evaluation: After training, the model's accuracy is evaluated on the test set.

This is a basic example of a neural network for classification tasks.   
You can experiment with more layers,  
different activation functions,  
and optimizers to improve performance.
